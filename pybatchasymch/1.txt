1. Set the Agenda
In Project Lambda, I outlined a clear roadmap for enabling a data pipeline that transformed small market data, refining 5000 files and identifying $12B in opportunities. By setting specific milestones and deliverables, I ensured that the team remained focused and on track.

For Project STrack, a self-initiative project, I established a clear vision and objectives to compile data processing steps into trackable insights using PySpark and Spring Boot. This proactive approach allowed us to create a robust system that provided valuable insights efficiently.

In the GCP project, I defined clear goals for rewriting the data ingestion process using PySpark and automating it through Google Cloud tools. My agenda-setting included coordinating with extended teams to ensure seamless integration and automation.

2. Bring Others with You
In Project Lambda, I fostered a collaborative environment by organizing knowledge-sharing sessions and workshops, enabling the team to overcome challenges in data transformation and achieve our goals collectively.

During Project STrack, I encouraged open communication and regular feedback through daily stand-ups and retrospectives. This collaborative approach allowed us to leverage diverse perspectives and innovative ideas, enhancing our problem-solving capabilities.

In the GCP project, collaboration with extended teams was crucial. I facilitated cross-team interactions and ensured everyone was aligned with the project objectives, leading to a successful rewrite of the data ingestion process and automation using Google Cloud tools.

For the Campaigns project, which involved enabling 45 campaigns for the large market and driving $23B in opportunity, I coordinated efforts across three different teams. My leadership ensured that design-intensive tasks were completed smoothly, and users were highly satisfied with the outcome.

3. Do It the Right Way
In Project Lambda, I ensured adherence to best practices for data security and compliance. Rigorous code reviews, thorough testing, and adherence to established coding standards were key to our success.

For Project STrack, I implemented automated testing and continuous integration pipelines for our Spring Boot APIs, significantly reducing the risk of bugs and enhancing the reliability of our applications.

In the GCP project, I prioritized quality and maintained high standards of excellence throughout the data ingestion process rewrite. This involved meticulous planning and execution, ensuring the automation was robust and efficient.

During the Campaigns project, I led the design-intensive effort by emphasizing best practices and quality standards. This meticulous approach resulted in highly effective campaigns that drove significant opportunities and user satisfaction.

This approach to leadership has enabled me to guide my team effectively, deliver high-quality results, and foster a collaborative and innovative working environment. By setting a clear agenda, bringing others along, and doing things the right way, I have contributed to the success of our projects and the overall goals of our organization.
