Install Required Libraries:
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip if they're not already available:

bash
Copy code
pip install pyspark
Create a Python Script for Parallel Execution:
Create a Python script that uses concurrent.futures to run your PySpark scripts in parallel and includes retry logic.

python
Copy code
import concurrent.futures
import subprocess
import time
from pathlib import Path

# List of PySpark scripts to run
scripts = [
    'script1.py',
    'script2.py',
    'script3.py',
    # Add more scripts as needed
]

# Number of retries for failed tasks
max_retries = 3
# Delay between retries in seconds
retry_delay = 300

def run_pyspark_script(script_path):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            result = subprocess.run(['spark-submit', script_path], check=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
            print(f"Successfully executed {script_path}")
            return result.stdout
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            print(f"Error executing {script_path}: {e.stderr}")
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                print(f"Retrying {script_path} in {retry_delay} seconds...")
                time.sleep(retry_delay)
            else:
                print(f"Failed to execute {script_path} after {max_retries} attempts.")
                raise

def main():
    # Use ThreadPoolExecutor to run scripts in parallel
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        futures = {executor.submit(run_pyspark_script, script): script for script in scripts}
        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
            script = futures[future]
            try:
                data = future.result()
                print(f"{script} output:\n{data}")
            except Exception as exc:
                print(f"{script} generated an exception: {exc}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Explanation:
Parallel Execution: The ThreadPoolExecutor is used to run multiple PySpark scripts in parallel.
Retry Logic: The run_pyspark_script function includes retry logic. If a script fails, it will retry up to max_retries times with a delay of retry_delay seconds between attempts.
Error Handling: If a script fails after the maximum number of retries, an exception is raised, and the error is logged.
Steps to Run:
Save the Script:
Save the above code to a file, e.g., run_pyspark_scripts.py.

Place Your PySpark Scripts:
Ensure your PySpark scripts (e.g., script1.py, script2.py, etc.) are in the same directory or update the paths in the scripts list accordingly.

Run the Python Script:
Execute the Python script to run your PySpark jobs in parallel with retry logic:

bash
Copy code
python run_pyspark_scripts.py
This approach leverages Python's standard library to achieve parallel execution and retry logic without requiring additional dependencies like Airflow.
