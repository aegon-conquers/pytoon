1. How has the colleague partnered with you this year?
Mona has been an incredibly engaged and collaborative product owner to work with this year. Her enthusiasm and proactive approach make her a fantastic partner, always ready to jump in and address user needs with energy and dedication. She’s highly reachable, approachable, and fosters a positive working environment through her humility and transparency. Her commitment to delivering what users ask for ensures that we stay responsive to immediate needs, and her collaborative spirit helps keep the team aligned and motivated.2. What top 1-3 Leadership behaviours has this colleague demonstrated? Provide specific examples of their strength.
Mona demonstrates several admirable leadership behaviors, including:  Proactiveness: Mona’s super-active approach shines through in her ability to quickly respond to user feedback. For example, when a critical user request came up during a recent sprint, Mona immediately rallied the team to prioritize and deliver a solution, ensuring user satisfaction.  
Humility: Her humble nature fosters a collaborative and inclusive environment. She’s always open to feedback, as seen when she actively sought input from the team during a planning session to ensure all perspectives were considered.  
Transparency: Mona’s transparent communication builds trust within the team. During project updates, she openly shares challenges and progress, such as when she clearly communicated a delay in a feature rollout to stakeholders, keeping everyone informed and aligned.

3. What is one leadership behaviour this colleague could further develop?
One area where Mona could grow is deepening her product knowledge to better align short-term deliverables with the long-term user journey and business/tech architecture vision. While her responsiveness to user requests is a strength, taking a more strategic approach by considering the broader product roadmap and technical implications could lead to more sustainable solutions. For example, incorporating more discussions with tech leads during planning could help balance immediate user needs with long-term architectural goals, ensuring a cohesive product strategy.4. What additional feedback would you like to share?
Working with Mona is truly a pleasure due to her infectious energy, openness, and dedication to the team’s success. Her ability to connect with others and maintain transparency makes her a valued colleague. By further developing her product expertise and focusing on long-term strategic planning, Mona has the potential to elevate her impact as a product owner even further. I’m excited to continue collaborating with her and supporting her growth in this role.
