You’ll mostly be adding GenAI “around” your existing GCP data platform: yes, you’ll use LLMs, but mainly via managed services (Vertex AI / Gemini, RAG patterns) rather than building models from scratch.[1][2][3]

Below I’ll keep it practical: what each idea needs, where it sits in your current stack, and roughly when to worry about it.

***

## Foundation – What you need in GCP

For almost everything we discussed, a simple reference setup is enough.[3][4][1]

- Data: Your current GCS → BigQuery (or warehouse) pipelines stay as they are. You may add a few “semantic views” that summarize AP files and recommendations for GenAI to read.[4][5]
- LLMs: Use managed LLMs (Gemini on Vertex AI or Gemini API) as “model as a service” – you call them from your backend/UI; no model training needed initially.[2][1][4]
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): For question-answering over your data or docs, you’ll add an embedding step (Vertex AI embeddings) and a vector store (BigQuery vector, Vertex AI Vector Search, or similar) that lets you retrieve relevant chunks before calling the LLM.[6][1][2]
- Serving: Existing APIs and UI call a small GenAI microservice (Cloud Run / GKE / Functions) that orchestrates: retrieve context → call LLM → return text answer.[1][4]

You can present this as: “We keep our data platform as-is, add an AI layer on top (Gemini + RAG), and expose it via the APIs/UI our users already use.”[3][4][1]

***

## Phase 1 – Small: how to implement

### 1) GenAI explainer for recommendations

Goal: For each account / vendor, generate a natural-language explanation like “Here’s what we see, here’s why we recommend X, here are risks.”[7][8]

You need:
- Inputs:  
  - Structured features: key metrics from the transformed AP data (spend, aging buckets, payment terms, anomalies, etc.).  
  - The recommendation your engine already produces and any rule/score behind it.  
- Flow (simple):  
  1. Backend collects the metrics + recommendation into a compact JSON.  
  2. Backend calls an LLM (Gemini) with a prompt like “Turn this JSON into a clear explanation for a B2B sales rep to use with a client. Audience is finance managers.”[2][4]
  3. UI shows the generated explanation next to your current recommendation panel.  

No RAG needed here; it’s templated prompting over structured data → very easy “first win.”[4][2]

***

### 2) Smart summary per AP file

Goal: After ingestion, output a one-pager: anomalies, trend changes, savings opportunities, and 2–3 suggested actions.[9][10]

You need:
- Inputs:  
  - Summary table for each file (e.g., precomputed stats + anomalies).  
  - Optional: link to previous file’s summary for that client.  
- Flow:  
  1. In your pipeline (or after it), generate a compact JSON summary of metrics (top vendors, unusual deltas, late payments, etc.).  
  2. Call the LLM with a “report writer” prompt: “You are a financial analyst summarizing AP data for a sales rep…” and pass in those metrics.  
  3. Store the generated summary in a table / document column; surface in UI and maybe send as an email draft.  

Again, this is just “LLM over structured metrics” – small, contained, and safe.[2][4]

***

### 3) Conversational help over dashboards

Goal: Let users ask questions in natural language on top of your existing dashboards (e.g., “What changed since last month for Client X?”).[1][4][2]

You need:
- Data access:  
  - Either: LLM calls that generate SQL for BigQuery, then you run it and return results.  
  - Or: Prebuilt “question templates” that map to known queries (safer at first).  
- Flow (simpler, Phase‑1 version):  
  1. User asks a question.  
  2. Backend pattern-matches the question to a small set of allowed query types (top N, trend vs previous period).  
  3. Run a prepared query in BigQuery, return a small result set.  
  4. Send results to LLM and ask it to “explain these numbers to a sales user.”  

Later, you can move to more advanced “LLM generates SQL, we validate” patterns (see BigQuery AI / Gemini for data analytics).[4][1][2]

***

### 4) Internal Q&A over docs / runbooks (RAG)

Goal: Bot for your team: “How do we handle missing GL codes?” or “What does ‘risk_score’ in the recommendation mean?”[6][1]

You need:
- Content: Export Confluence, specs, data dictionaries into text chunks.  
- RAG setup:  
  1. Chunk documents (e.g., 500–1,000 tokens per chunk).  
  2. Compute embeddings using Vertex AI and store them in BigQuery or Vertex AI Vector Search.[6][1]
  3. At query time: embed the user’s question, retrieve top‑k chunks, pack them into the prompt, then call the LLM.  

This is the classic RAG pattern; GCP has reference blueprints you can reuse almost as-is.[3][1][6]

***

## Phase 2 – Medium: deeper workflow integration

### 1) Sales playbook copilot (per client)

Goal: For each client, draft talking points, email templates, and negotiation angles based on their AP patterns and previous insights.[11][12][7]

You need:
- Inputs:  
  - AP-derived metrics + recommendation.  
  - Historical summaries, if available.  
  - Optionally some anonymized examples of “good” sales emails or call notes (for style).  
- Flow:  
  1. Build an “analysis view” combining key client metrics and insights.  
  2. Prompt LLM: “Given this client’s AP behavior and recommended actions, generate: (a) 3 bullet talking points; (b) an email draft to the AP manager; (c) a short risk/opportunity summary.”  
  3. Surface as suggestions in the UI with copy-edit capability.  

Here the LLM is co-writing user-facing content, so you also add guardrails (tone, no confidential data; maybe require manual approve before sending).[12][11]

***

### 2) Intelligent exception handling

Goal: When a file fails ingestion or quality checks, auto‑summarize why and propose next steps for ops.[10][13]

You need:
- Inputs: logs, error codes, and DQ results in a structured way (error type, column, rule violated).  
- Flow:  
  1. Gather error context into JSON.  
  2. Call LLM with prompt: “Explain in simple operational language what went wrong and suggest 2–3 remediation steps. Don’t invent causes not present in data.”  
  3. Show this in your monitoring UI / alerting channel.  

This reduces triage time and helps newer team members understand complex errors quicker.[13][10]

***

### 3) AP insights library (insight cards)

Goal: Automatically discover and describe patterns, e.g., “Duplicate invoice risk”, “Vendors with worsening payment behavior,” etc.[9][10]

You need:
- Analytics logic: SQL / data science jobs that generate candidate insights (e.g., threshold-based patterns) per client or globally.  
- Flow:  
  1. Your logic detects patterns and tags them with metadata (client, vendor, we found X, severity).  
  2. LLM turns each pattern into an “insight card” description and a suggested action (“Discuss term changes with vendor Y”).  
  3. Store cards in a table and surface as a feed in the UI.  

GenAI here is the narration; the actual detection should still be your deterministic code to ensure correctness.[10][9]

***

### 4) Guided analysis in the dashboard

Goal: Users can click “Explain this view” and get narrative insight (“Your overdue amounts decreased 10%, mainly in vendor group A…”).[2][4]

You need:
- Predefined queries backing each dashboard (you already have).  
- Flow:  
  1. When user is on a dashboard filter (client X, period Y), backend runs a pre-defined query to get key stats.  
  2. LLM receives: the metric table + a prompt like “Write a concise narrative explaining changes since last period, highlighting top 3 changes and potential reasons.”  
  3. Display as a text panel aligned with the chart.  

This is where GenAI turns your BI into “storytelling,” which business users love.[4][2]

***

## Phase 3 – Big: architecture and approach

### 1) Next‑best opportunity / action engine

Goal: Use combined AP + CRM-like data + historical outcomes to recommend which clients to prioritize and what to propose.[8][7][12]

You need:
- Data foundation: join transformed AP data with sales outcomes (won/lost opportunities, product usage, etc.).  
- Modeling approach:  
  - Start with classical ML for prediction (who will respond to X offer) and use GenAI to explain predictions and generate messaging.  
  - Later, consider “AI agent” style flows that simulate sequences of actions.[2][4]
- Serving: Expose as recommendations API consumed by your UI and sales tools.  

When presenting, emphasize this as a revenue accelerator, not just analytics.[7][8]

***

### 2) Productized AP advisory & customer-facing GenAI

Goal: Turn your internal insights + GenAI into a semi-automated “AP advisory” service and self-serve GenAI features for clients.[13][9]

You need:
- Everything from Phase 2, but hardened for external use (SLA, security, strong guardrails).  
- RAG over each client’s own AP history and documentation, so they can ask: “Where are my biggest cash-flow risks over the next 90 days?”[1][6]
- Multi-tenant isolation: each customer only accesses their data and their vector index partition; careful auth at the API layer.  

Architecturally, this is the same AI layer you use internally, just exposed with more controls and monitoring.[3][6][1]

## How to answer “Do we need LLMs?” in the meeting

You can phrase it like this (adapt in your own words):

- “We don’t need to build models from scratch. We’ll use managed LLMs on Google Cloud (Gemini / Vertex AI) as services, similar to how we use BigQuery today.”[1][4][2]
- “For analytics and internal Q&A, we follow the standard Google Cloud RAG blueprint: store our docs/metadata as vectors, retrieve relevant pieces, and let the LLM generate grounded answers.”[6][3][1]
- “Our core differentiator remains our AP transformation and recommendation logic; GenAI wraps it with explanations, summaries, and sales-ready content.”[4][2]

If you share which exact components you use now (BigQuery vs something else, Looker vs custom UI, etc.), I can sketch a 1-slide “reference architecture” text for each phase that you can directly put into your deck.
